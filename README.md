# ZeroBlink

We operate in the silence between blinks.

Our mission is to expose vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. We are the unseen guardians, the digital shadows, the silent killers of insecurity.

We do not seek fame. We do not seek recognition. We seek only the truth hidden within the code.

Expect us.
